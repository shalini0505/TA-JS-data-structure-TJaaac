2. Answer the following with reason:

- `user == newUser;` // true because the vale of user is inserted in newUser
- `user === newUser;`//true reason- when we call user then ans will be arya ,sibling and we creat newUser name and we put value user and compare them and result will we be same.
- `user.name === newUser.name;`//output and reason Ans- true reason- when we call user.name then ans will be arya and we creat newUser.name and we put value user.name and compare to newUser and result will be true.
- `user.name == newUser.name;`//output and reason Ans- true reason- when we call user.name then ans will be arya and we creat newUser.name and we put value user.name and compare to newUser and result will be true.
- `user.sibling == newUser.sibling;`//output and reason Ans- true reason- when we call user.sibling then ans will be robb, ryan, and john and again we convert user.sibilng to newUser.sibling and compare to each other and result will be true.

- `user.sibling === newUser.sibling;`//output and reason Ans- true reason- when we call user.sibling then ans will be robb, ryan, and john and again we convert user.sibilng to newUser.sibling and compare to each other and result will be true.

- `user.sibling == allBrothers;`// output and reason Ans- false when we call user.sibling then ans will be robb, ryan,and john and we comparing to user.sibling and compare to allBrothers result will we false because allBrothers are totally different box.
- `user.sibling === allBrothers;`//// output and reason Ans- false when we call user.sibling then ans will be robb, ryan,and john and we comparing to user.sibling and compare to allBrothers result will we false because allBrothers are totally different box.
- `brothersCopy === allBrothers;` false when we call user.sibling then ans will be robb, ryan,and john and we comparing to user.sibling and compare to allBrothers result will we false because allBrothers are totally different box.
- `brothersCopy == allBrothers;` false when we call user.sibling then ans will be robb, ryan,and john and we comparing to user.sibling and compare to allBrothers result will we false because allBrothers are totally different box.
- `brothersCopy == user.sibling;`true reason- when we call brothersCopy then ans will be robb, ryan, and john and again we convert brothersCopy to User.sibling and compare to each other and result will be true.
- `brothersCopy === user.sibling;`true reason- when we call brothersCopy then ans will be robb, ryan, and john and again we convert brothersCopy to User.sibling and compare to each other and result will be true.
- `brothersCopy[0] === user.sibling[0];`//true
- `brothersCopy[1] === user.sibling[1];`//true
- `user.sibling[1] === newUser.sibling[1];`//true
